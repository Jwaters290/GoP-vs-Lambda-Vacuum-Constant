# GoP-vs-Lambda-Vacuum-Constant
A simple Python demonstration comparing the ΛCDM cosmological constant’s vacuum energy density with the emergent vacuum scale predicted by the Gravity of Probability (GoP) framework—showing GoP reproduces Λ’s value without cosmological tuning.


# GoP vs Λ Vacuum Constant Comparison

This repository provides a small, transparent Python demonstration comparing the 
vacuum energy density required by the ΛCDM cosmological constant (Λ) with the 
emergent vacuum scale predicted by the Gravity of Probability (GoP) framework.

In ΛCDM, Λ is a tuned phenomenological constant chosen to match the observed 
cosmic acceleration. GoP, in contrast, produces a vacuum energy density of the 
same order of magnitude *without* cosmological tuning, using a fixed global 
parameter set constrained independently from galaxy dynamics and decoherence 
physics.

The script `lambda_vs_gop_vacuum_constant.py` computes:

- The ΛCDM vacuum energy density  
- The GoP emergent vacuum energy density  
- Their numerical ratio  

The result shows that GoP’s fixed parameters naturally reproduce the observed 
dark-energy scale (∼10⁻¹⁰ J/m³), whereas ΛCDM must set Λ by hand. This repository 
serves as a clear, minimal reference illustrating that GoP turns the cosmological 
constant from an input into an output.

## Notes

- This repository is intentionally minimal and designed for clarity. Its purpose is
  to provide a clean comparison between the ΛCDM vacuum constant and the emergent
  vacuum density predicted by the Gravity of Probability (GoP) using fixed global
  parameters (κA, E₀).

- The numerical agreement is an order-of-magnitude demonstration of a key GoP
  feature: what ΛCDM treats as a tuned cosmological constant emerges naturally
  from decoherence-driven probabilistic curvature without cosmological fitting.

- The code here is not a complete GoP implementation; it is a focused, 
  easy-to reproduce calculation meant to illustrate this conceptual distinction.

- For full analyses, datasets, lensing models, and the complete GoP series of
  papers, refer to the Figshare profile included above.
